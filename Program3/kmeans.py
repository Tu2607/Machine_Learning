# Data set: 2d data simulated from 3 Gaussians, with considerable
# overlap. THere are 500 points from each Gaussian, ordered together
# in the file.

# Implement the standard version of the K-Means algorithm. The initial
# starting points for the K cluster means can be K randomly selected
# data points.
